# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of problems based on **Descriptive** and **Inferential Statistics**, focusing on core concepts such as central tendency, variance, standard deviation, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. The problems and their solutions are designed to help understand statistical techniques and their practical applications in analyzing data.

## Problems and Solutions

### Q1. Key Statistical Definitions
Definitions of key statistical terms like **Population**, **Sample**, **Descriptive Statistics**, and **Inferential Statistics**, and others.

### Q2. Measures of Central Tendency
Explanation of **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode** with examples for each.

### Q3. Manual Calculation of Mean, Median, and Mode
Step-by-step calculations for **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode** using a provided dataset.

### Q4. Levels of Measurement
Definitions and examples for the four levels of measurement: **Nominal**, **Ordinal**, **Interval**, and **Ratio**.

### Q5. Variance and Standard Deviation - Theory
Definitions of **Variance** and **Standard Deviation**, and the reasoning behind why **Standard Deviation** is more interpretable than **Variance**.

### Q6. Manual Calculation - Variance and Standard Deviation
Manual calculations of **Variance** and **Standard Deviation** using a given dataset.

### Q7. Range and Interquartile Range (IQR)
Calculations of **Range**, **Q1**, **Q3**, and **IQR** for a given dataset.

### Q8. Five-number Summary and Boxplot Concept
Explanation of the **Five-number summary** (Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum) and how **boxplots** can help in detecting outliers.

### Q9. Confidence Interval for the Mean
Step-by-step calculation of the **95% Confidence Interval** for the population mean based on sample data.

### Q10. Hypothesis Testing - One Sample Z-Test
Detailed solution to the **One Sample Z-Test**, including hypothesis formulation, Z-score calculation, and conclusion.
